Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (FEEE) Students Performance Analysis

I'm thrilled to share with you my latest data analysis project where I dived deep into analyzing student performance using powerful tools and techniques. Let's explore the fascinating insights and discoveries I made along the way.

Project Overview:
In this project, I worked with a comprehensive dataset containing information about students' performance, including their IDs, majors, subjects, semesters, practical and theoretical scores, total marks, status, and official year. It's important to note that the dataset had some limitations, including incomplete data and errors. However, with careful analysis and data-cleaning techniques, I was able to derive meaningful insights from the available data.

Techniques and Tools Used:
To conduct a thorough analysis, I employed a combination of powerful tools and techniques. I utilized Pandas, a Python library for data manipulation and analysis, to clean and preprocess the raw data. Additionally, I leveraged SQLite, a lightweight database engine, to store and query the data efficiently. Moreover, I harnessed the power of Power Query, a feature in Power BI, to transform and shape the data for visualization.

Visualizations and Findings:
1. Top Performing Subjects: Using Power BI, I created a visualization showcasing the subjects with the highest average total marks. By examining this chart, we can identify the subjects where students have excelled the most.

2. Subject Performance by Semester: Through Power BI's interactive stacked column chart, I compared the performance of subjects across different semesters. By analyzing this chart, we can determine the subjects that consistently perform well or show variations over time.

3. Compare Practical and Theoretical Scores: By leveraging Pandas and SQLite, I analyzed and compared the practical and theoretical scores for each subject. This analysis provided insights into how students are performing in different types of assessments.

4. Student Performance Trends: With Power BI's versatile visualizations, I created a vertical bar chart to showcase the performance trends over different semesters. By including the total marks, theoretical scores, and practical scores, we can observe the overall progress of students and identify any correlations or discrepancies.

Key Findings:
Throughout the analysis, several key findings emerged. It's important to note that due to the data's incompleteness and errors, the findings should be interpreted with caution. However, some insights included consistent top-performing subjects across different semesters, higher practical scores compared to theoretical scores, and a gradual improvement in student performance over the years.

Impact and Future Scope:
This data analysis project showcases the power of leveraging Python's Pandas and SQLite for data manipulation and Power Query in Power BI for data transformation. By employing these tools, I was able to analyze the available data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. Moving forward, obtaining complete and accurate data would further enhance the insights and enable more robust analysis.


By combining the capabilities of Pandas, SQLite, and Power Query, we can unlock valuable insights into student performance, even with incomplete and error-prone data. This project demonstrates how these tools empower us to perform data manipulation, conduct in-depth analysis, and visualize data effectively using Power BI.
